# passgen
A password generator

I am working on encryption functions currently, the software has not been properly debugged and is unstable currently.

- Login data and encryption key are stored in a JSON file and Key file respectively.
- Both of these can be accessed via notepad/IDEs/etc, therefore your data is not completely safe.
- Feel free to modify the program as you see fit and make any changes you want.
